## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose
Build a mobile application that integrates with the existing Origami Claims backend system to enable doctor-patient interactions via mobile devices. For context, this codebase is for the mobile app, and we're building the mobile app as a mobile version of the Sana Benefits web platform (which uses the name Origami Claims for the patient side of it). The doctor side of it is the Care Platform.

### Background
- The existing system uses TypeScript and has a PostgreSQL database
- The mobile app will be built as a separate, standalone codebase
- The app will connect to existing backend APIs
- Key focus areas include doctor-patient interactions, user authentication, messaging, and security compliance

## 2. Architecture Overview

### High-Level Architecture
```
Mobile App (React Native) → Origami Claims API → Care Platform API → PostgreSQL Database
```

### Key Principles
- The mobile app will NEVER directly access the database
- All data access will be through the existing API endpoints
- Authentication tokens will be securely stored on the mobile device
- Follow mobile security best practices (certificate pinning, secure storage, etc.)

## 3. Technical Stack Decision

### Chosen Framework: React Native
- **Rationale**: Alignment with existing TypeScript codebase, cross-platform capabilities, developer familiarity
- **Approach**: Using Expo for faster initial development

## 4. Requirements & Features

### User Authentication
- Secure login/logout functionality
- Token-based authentication
- Biometric authentication options (fingerprint/face)
- Password reset flow

### User Profile Management
- View and edit profile information
- Profile image upload
- Settings and preferences

### Doctor-Patient Interaction
- View patient/doctor list
- Patient history and records access
- Appointment scheduling
- Video consultation capabilities

### Messaging
- Secure in-app messaging between doctors and patients
- Push notifications for new messages
- Message history and search

### Security Features
- Data encryption (in transit and at rest)
- Session timeout and automatic logout
- Secure storage of sensitive information
- HIPAA compliance measures

### Offline Capabilities
- Basic functionality when offline
- Queue updates for sync when back online
- Clear indicators of connection status
